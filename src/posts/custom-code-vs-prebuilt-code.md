As a web developer, you may often find yourself faced with the decision of whether to use "custom" code or prebuilt libraries when building a website or web application. Both options have their own pros and cons, and the best choice will depend on the specific needs of your project.

One key advantage of using **custom code** is that it allows you to have complete control over every aspect of your project. This can be particularly useful if you need to implement a unique feature or if you want to ensure that your code is optimized for performance.

On the other hand, Using a **prebuilt library** can save you a significant amount of time and effort, as it provides a ready-made solution that you can use without having to write your own code. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using prebuilt libraries.

For one, prebuilt libraries can be large and complex, and they may include more functionality than you actually need for your project. This can make your project more difficult to maintain and can also increase the size of your codebase, which can affect performance.

Additionally, prebuilt libraries can sometimes be difficult to customize and may not provide you with the level of control that you need. For example, if you want to make a small change to the way a library functions, you may have to dig through a large amount of code to find the right place to make the change.

Here is a quick pros and cons list to summarize the differences between using custom code and prebuilt libraries:

<br>

Custom Code

| Pros                                     | Cons                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete control over your project       | Takes more time and effort to create                            |
| Can optimize your code for performance   | May require a deeper understanding of the underlying technology |
| Can implement unique or complex features |                                                                 |

Prebuilt Libraries

| Pros                                               | Cons                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can save time and effort                           | May include more functionality than you need                     |
| Can provide a ready-made solution for common tasks | Can be difficult to customize and may not provide enough control |
|                                                    | Can increase the size and complexity of your project             |

Ultimately, the choice between using custom code and prebuilt libraries will depend on the specific needs of your project. If you need to implement a unique feature or if you want to have complete control over your project, using custom code may be the best option. However, if you need to get a project up and running quickly and don't need a high level of customization, using a prebuilt library can be a good choice.
