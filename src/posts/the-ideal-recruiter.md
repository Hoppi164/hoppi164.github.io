I've read many articles about how a recruiter can spot "[The ideal candidate](https://resources.workable.com/stories-and-insights/qualities-of-good-employee-and-candidate)" but what about the ideal recruiter?

I've been in the tech industry for a while now and I've had my fair share of interactions with recruiters. Some of these interactions have been great, however most have been less than ideal.

I've compiled a list of qualities that I believe make up the ideal recruiter. If you're a recruiter, I hope you find this list helpful and if you're a job seeker, I hope you find a recruiter that embodies these qualities.

## The Ideal Recruiter

### Provides Detailed Job Descriptions

The ideal recruiter will happily provide the following information in their very first message to a candidate:

- The company name
- The job title
- The job description
- The salary range
- The location
- The working hours
- The contract type (permanent, contract, part-time, full-time)
- The benefits
- The team size
- The tech stack
- The interview process

<br>
No recruiter can expect a candidate to apply for a job without providing a detailed job description.
<br>
Any recruiter who doesn't provide this information is not worth working with. <br>Here's why:<br><br>

<details>
<summary>If they <b>Don't have the necessary information</b>
</summary>
It's likely that they're not working closely with the hiring manager, and they're just trying to fill a quota.
<br><br>
Some recruiter scan seek.com.au for job listings, then contact the candidates directly, attempting to act as a middleman without a contract with the employer
<br><br>
This is a huge waste of time for both the employer and the candidates; as they will not be providing any value to either party.

</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>If they <b>Don't want to share the information</b>
</summary>

Recruiters without a solid contract with the employer will sometimes try to "keep the candidate in the dark" to avoid losing the candidate to another recruiter or a direct application.
<br><br>
This kind of attitude is a red flag of a rookie recruiter, or a recruiter that doesn't have the best interests of the candidate in mind.
<br><br>

A recruiter that deliberately withholds information from candidates is going to be a nightmare to work with, and most employers would rather not work with them.

### Communicates Clearly

- The ideal recruiter will communicate with candidates via the candidates preferred method. ( Email, Phone, Text )
- They will provide canididates and employers with regular updates on the application process.
- They will always provide clear, unambiguous information.

The job of a recruiter is to find candidates and facilitate communication.

If a candidate is better at communicating than the recruiter then they are better off applying directly to the employer.

If the employer is better at communicating than the recruiter then they are better off hiring directly.

> A recruiter that communicates clearly is going to have a better relationship with the candidate, and the employer.

### Understands The Role

Recruiter's should specialize in a particular field, and they should have a good understanding of the roles they're recruiting for.

If you're recruiting for a software developer role, you should understand the difference between a front-end developer, a back-end developer, and a full-stack developer.

You should know not to approach a Java developer for a Javascript role, and you should know the difference between a software developer and a software engineer.
( Hint they're the same thing )

> A recruiter who understands the role is going to have the best odds of placing a successful candidate.

### Provides Feedback

A recruiter should always be mindful of the value they're providing to both the candidate and the employer.

If a candidate is unsuccessful in their application, the recruiter should provide feedback on why they were unsuccessful, and what they can do to improve.

If an employer is having trouble finding employees, the recruiter should provide feedback on what they can do to better entice valuable candidates.

> A recruiter that provides feedback is a recruiter that provides value.

### Is Honest

A recruiter should always be honest about the role, the company, and the salary. They should also be honest about the candidate's chances of getting the role.

A recruiter should never put forward a candidate for an unsuitable role, or they will lose the trust of the employer.

> A recruiter that is honest with you is a recruiter that you can trust.

### Is Respectful

A recruiter should respect candidates time, and their privacy. They should only contact candidates via their preferred method of communication during an established timeframe.

It's important to remember that many candidates are currently employed, and they may not be able to take calls during work hours.

Most recruiter's will be polite and respectful to the employer but often forget to be respectful to the candidate.

> The recruiter works for both the candidate and the employer, and they should be respectful of both parties.

## Conclusion

The ideal recruiter is a professional who

- Provides valuable information
- Communicates clearly
- Understands the role
- Provides feedback
- Is honest
- Is respectful

The most vital aspect of a recruiter is their ability to provide value to both the candidate and the employer.
