---

I've been working remotely for the past 4 years, and i've loved every minute of it.
I'm often asked by recruiters, and potential employers why i only work remotely, so i thought i'd write an article about it.

Ultimately, i work remotely because it allows me to be more productive, and it allows me to have a better work-life balance.

The pro's completely outweigh the con's for me, and i'm not sure i could ever go back to working in an office.

## The Pro's

<hr>

### No Commute

By far the biggest pro for me is not having to commute to work.
I used to drive 30 minutes to work each way, and it was a huge waste of time.
I'd often get stuck in traffic, and it would always put me in a bad mood when i got to work, and when i got home.

There's nothing worse than a grueling commute with standstill traffic, and then having to sit at a desk for 8 hours.

There's also the hidden costs of commuting, such as fuel, car maintenance, and the time spent driving that you're not getting compensated for.

#### The Hidden Costs Of Commuting

Lets run some numbers:

**Time**

<details>
    <summary>Assumptions</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>You work in full time employment and work 5 days a week</li>
        <li>You have a 30 minute commute each way to and from work</li>
        <li>There are <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/article/how-many-working-days-in-a-year">251 working days in a year</a></li>
        <li>You do not get paid for your commute</li>
    </ul>
</details>

```
30 Minutes * 2 = 1 Hour Each Day
1 Hour * 251 Days = 251 Hours In Traffic Each Year
251 Hours / 8 Working Hours = 31.375 Full Work Days Each Year
```

**Fuel**

<details>
    <summary>Assumptions</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>You drive to work</li>
        <li>You drive a car that uses 10L/100km</li>
        <li>You drive 20km to work each way</li>
        <li>You work 5 days a week</li>
        <li>There are <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/article/how-many-working-days-in-a-year">251 working days in a year</a></li>
        <li>You own your car outright and do not have any finance on it</li>
        <li>You pay for your own fuel</li>
        <li>You pay for your own maintenance</li>
        <li>you get your car serviced every 10,000km ( the recommended service interval for most cars )</li>
        <li>You pay $331, for your car service ( <a href="https://takeatumble.com.au/guides/how-much-does-a-car-service-cost/">the average cost of a car service in Queensland</a>)</li>
    </ul>
</details>

```
20km * 2 = 40km Driven Each Day
40km / 100 = 0.4L Each Day
0.4L * 251 Days = 100.4L Each Year
100.4L * $1.50 = $150.60 In Fueld Each Year
```

**Car Maintenance**

```
40km * 251 Days = 10,040km Each Year
10,040km / 10,000km = 1.004 Services Each Year
1 Service * $331 = $331 In Maintenance Each Year
```

**Total**

<details>
<summary>Assumptions</summary>
<ul>
    <li>You are paid $75,000 a year (<a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/AU/Job=Software_Developer/Salary">The median salary of a Software Developer in Australia</a> )</li>
</ul>
</details>

```
$75,000 Salary / 251 Days = $298.80 Each Day
$298.80 * 31.375 Days = $9,389.40 Each Year In Unpaid Time
$150.60 + $331 = $481.60 Each Year In Fuel And Maintenance
$9,389.40 + $481.60 = $9,871 Each Year In Total Costs
```

<em>That's almost $10,000 a year i'm saving in hidden costs!</em>

### Controlled Environment

I quit one of my previous jobs because the office was too noisy, and i couldn't concentrate.

At my home office, i have near complete control over my environment.

There are no:

- Overwhelming sounds of multiple conversations happening at once
- Sounds of coworkers arguing in the meeting room
- People walking past my desk
- Trucks reversing outside the window
- People talking loudly on the phone in the next cubicle
- Beeping of the break room microwave
- Screeching of the coffee machine

I can listen to music, or work in silence, and i can control the temperature of the room.

I work in a comfortable chair, and a desk that's at the perfect height for me.

Noise is a huge distraction for me, and i believe it's a huge productivity killer for most people, whether they realise it or not.

I often feel bad for my in-office coworkers on video calls when they're clearly struggling to pay attention to the conversation because of the background noise in the office.

<br>

### Flexibility

I can work from anywhere in the world, as long as i have an internet connection.

As it stands i work from home, but i could just as easily work from a cafe, or a co-working space, or a library, or a park, or a beach.

I can work the hours that suit me, and i can take breaks when i need to.

These are things that are not possible in an office environment.

Companies often have seminars on ergonomics, and the importance of taking regular breaks, and the importance of a good work-life balance. My experience is that as soon as you walk out the door of the seminar you are expected to forget everything you just learned and get back to work.

Working from home allows me to practice what the seminars preach.

- Every 30 minutes i get up and do a quick stretch without feeling like i'm being watched
- I can take a 10 minute break to make a cup of tea, or go for a walk, or do some housework

I can work the hours that suit me, and i can take breaks when i need to.

Every "Remote First" business i've worked for has been very flexible with hours, They're happy as long as you're getting your work done and are available for any important meetings.

- Somedays i start work at 6am and finish at 2pm
- Somedays i start work at 10am and finish at 6pm

<br>

### Work-Life Balance

I have a better work-life balance working remotely.

The time i save not commuting to work, i can spend with my family, or on hobbies, or on personal projects.

I can take my dog for a walk on my lunch break, or watch 30 minutes of TV, or do some gardening.

It's shocking to look back and remember how little time i had for myself when i was commuting to work, had to have a short lunch break where i'd either eat at my desk or stare at my phone in the break room as i ate my lunch.

<br>

### No Office Politics

I've worked in a few offices, and i've never enjoyed the politics that come with it.

I've seen people get fired because they're not friends with the boss, or because they're not good at talking themselves up, or because they're not good at playing "the game".

This kind of stuff doesn't happen in a remote environment, because you're judged on your work, not on how well you can play politics.

There is significantly less drama, and miscommunication in a remote environment; as almost everything is written down, and there's a lot less room for interpretation.
This results in a much more transparent and fair work environment.

<br>

### No Dress Code

I can wear whatever i want when i work from home.

Sure it would be innapropriate to wear pyjamas to a video call with a client, but i can wear a t-shirt and shorts, or a hoodie and trackpants, or a button up shirt and jeans.

There's no need to spend money on a work wardrobe, and there's no need to spend time ironing shirts, or shining shoes.

<br><br>

## The Con's

<hr>

### Loneliness

I'm an introvert, so i don't mind being alone, but i can see how working remotely could be lonely for some people.

I've heard of people who work remotely who have a hard time making friends, and who have a hard time separating work from home life.

I've rarely had this problem, as i have a few friends who also work remotely, and i'm a member of a few online communities where i can chat with other remote workers.

<br>

### Distractions

I have a dog, and he's a huge distraction.

He's very cute, and sometimes begs for attention while i'm working.
Thankfully he's very well behaved, and he's happy to sleep on the couch most of the day.

<br><br><br>

## Conclusion

<hr>

I've been working remotely for the past 4 years, and i've loved every minute of it.

The pro's completely outweigh the con's for me, and i'm not sure i could ever go back to working in an office.

I'm more productive, i have a better work-life balance, and i'm happier.

I'm not saying that remote work is for everyone, but it's definitely for me.
